The integration of TSN with the triaged WiFi 6, otherwise known as 802.11ax, proves to be a giant leap into the healthcare solution—a field in which data transfers must be reliable in time and size. Wi-Fi 6 brings big improvements to bandwidth, latency, and device density, making it ideal for high-density, connected medical device environments. On the other side, TSN ensures low-latency, deterministic transmission for time-critical applications, such as remote surgery, patient monitoring, or real-time diagnostics.
It is an important field, as with each day, there are increasing demands in healthcare for wireless communication: even at minor levels of delays or data loss, the impacts would be severest. The seamless integration of WiFi 6 and TSN can consequently revolutionize healthcare with much more robust, reliable, and scalable networks to back up the wide range of critical medical applications. This further warrants investigation for optimization and full realization of the potential in healthcare setups.
1.	Problem 
The challenge described by this project is centered on how communication in a healthcare environment can be achieved with reliable and low-latency communication when time-critical data transmission becomes paramount. Existing wireless networks are often hit with congestion, interference, and variable latency, which may pose threats to the safety of patients and effectiveness of medical procedures. WiFi 6's integration with Time-sensitive Networking seeks to overcome these challenges and provide healthcare applications with a more dependable and efficient wireless infrastructure.
